Hey, [I'm Jared](http://www.twitter.com/imjared). 

I'm currently working at [Patronage](https://patronage.org) as a web developer. Prior to my time here, I worked at [nclud](http://nclud.com) and [Blue State Digital](http://bluestatedigital.com). I'm primarily a JavaScript developer who focuses on writing React

When I'm not toying on the computer, I'm probably roaming the streets of my current hometown, Washington DC, studying Spanish, or running with my pals at [Pacers](https://runpacers.com).

If you're looking for a bit more about what I can do and  what I know, check out my code on [github](https://www.github.com/imjared) or find me on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/628699/imjared).
