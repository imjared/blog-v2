This is where I really got my feet wet in the world of web dev. I took comps from .psd and built them in ExpressionEngine. I started the job using XHTML and when HTML5 was born, I used that and trained my team to follow. I helped rebuild BSD’s default ExpressionEngine framework, led the team’s inital push into responsive design, and encouraged a company-wide shift to using Sass for CSS. I assisted in hiring and standardized our front-end interview process.

#### tools/libraries/frameworks I used and enjoyed:
- ExpressionEngine
- Github
- HTML5/CSS3
- jQuery
- jsPerf
- Phpfog
- SCSS/Compass
