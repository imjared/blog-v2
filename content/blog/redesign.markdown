I spent a bit of time working on a redesign. My <a href="/images/site/defaultskin.png" target="_blank">starting point</a> was certainly functional but it was the default for Octopress and I wanted something different. I wasn't happy with it but as I said in my first post, I just needed to get something that I could start blogging on.

Here I am about a year and a half later and while I haven't made a ton of progress on blogging—this will be only my eighth published post—I have used this blog. It has been a fun place to tinker and most recently, toy with design.

In the spirit of the [great king](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content#Content_is_king), I've removed almost everything from this blog except comments. Even those may disappear at some point. I'm tired of slow, I'm tired of bulk, I just want content and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRTkCHE1sS4" target="_blank">I want it now</a>.
