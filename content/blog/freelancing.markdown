I've been taking on a [bit](http://www.newdirectors.org) [more](http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com) [freelancing](http://www.filmlinc.com) work lately. It's been really fun (and really not-so-fun, Wordpress database migration, anyone?) working with a [friend/really talented designer](http://www.iamdavedawson.com). I'm learning tons along the way and not just on the technical side of things but also in the world of business and relationships.

I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the freelancing. I'm sacrificing other parts of life to do work outside of work but I think it's time well spent.

I was checking my usual news sites and stumbled across a really insightful post from Alan Hollis, "[My first year freelancing](http://alanhollis.com/my-first-year-freelancing/)". It has some great tips and gave me a lot to think about.

Just as important as the article though is the [discussion following it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5714930). I don't know how to digest it all right now, but I like what I'm reading. I'll close this post with the following from user [damoncali](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5716441):

> You need to get out of the mindset of charging for your time. You are charging for the value you create - and time is just a crude approximation of that at best.
